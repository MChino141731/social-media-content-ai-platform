Brand Guidelines
Our brand targets customers who care about the environment and the well-being of their skin, with a friendly, empathetic, and positive tone of voice. We communicate in a simple and clear way, avoiding overly technical terms, to truly bring people closer to our values of sustainability and respect for nature.
The values that guide us are environmental sustainability, innovation in product quality, transparency in information, and a natural care approach for the person. We believe that taking care of the body also means taking care of the planet.
In our content, we prefer to use terms like “solid shampoo,” “natural shower gel,” “gentle body wash,” and “natural moisturizing creams.” We talk about nourishing body products, formulated with natural ingredients, which reduce waste thanks to eco-friendly and recyclable packaging. Sustainability is at the heart of every choice we make.
On the contrary, we avoid words like “chemical,” “artificial,” “synthetic,” or “low cost,” as they do not represent the brand’s philosophy.
Our visual style is based on a natural color palette, featuring leaf green, beige, and white, evoking elements of nature like leaves, water, and earth. For fonts, we prefer Roboto and Lato, modern yet simple, in line with the clarity of our message.
For social media and campaigns, we use official hashtags such as #EcoBeauty, #NaturalRespect, #GreenRoutine, #ZeroWaste, #Sustainability, and #BodyCare to strengthen the sense of community and green commitment.
Typical calls to action we encourage in our texts include:
“Discover our new solid shampoo!”,
“Try the natural shower gel for healthy skin!”,
“Moisturize your skin with our natural cream!”,
“Join the green revolution!” and
“Take care of your skin and the planet!”.
