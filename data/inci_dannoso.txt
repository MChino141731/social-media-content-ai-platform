INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients) is the list of ingredients contained in every beauty product: shampoo, body wash, deodorant, face cream, etc. The first ingredient listed is the one present in the highest quantity, followed by other components in decreasing concentrations.
It’s often a list of confusing words that people tend to ignore, trusting instead more visually prominent labels, slogans, or brand names that ultimately convince us to buy a product. This is not superficiality, but rather a tendency to rely on a brand, a logo, or a slogan without personally understanding what we are really putting on our bodies (and thus absorbing!).
We need to become familiar with INCI ingredients and understand their terminology better to eliminate products containing harmful ingredients.

PETROLATUMS  
These are petroleum-derived substances. They are occlusive (they don’t let the skin breathe) and are not skin-compatible.  
On labels, they appear as: Paraffinum Liquidum, Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Vaseline, Ceresin, Ozokerite.
---
SILICONES  
These substances are not skin-compatible and create a film on skin and hair that gives a false moisturizing effect.  
On labels, they appear as: Dimethicone, Dimeticonol, Polydimethylsiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Quaternium-80, Amodimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate.

PRESERVATIVES (allergenic or harmful)  
Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.  
**Parabens** (endocrine disruptors): Isobutyl Paraben, Butyl Paraben, Methyl Paraben, Propylparaben, Benzyl Paraben, Ethyl Paraben.  
**Formaldehyde releasers** (carcinogenic): Sodium Hydroxymethyl Glycinate, Bronopol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Benzylhemiformal, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Quaternium-15, DMDM Hydantoin.  
**Antimicrobials**: Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA), Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT), Triclosan.

EMULSIFIERS  
Synthetic substances that facilitate product fluidity. PEGs and PPGs can be contaminated with ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane (carcinogenic).  
On labels, they appear as: Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), Dipolyhydroxystearate, PEG6, PEG20, PEG75, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polypropylene Glycol, Ethylene Glycol.
---
SURFACTANTS  
Chemically derived and aggressive, can dehydrate the skin.  
On labels, they appear as: Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, TEA-Lauryl Sulfate, Magnesium Laureth Sulfate, MEA Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), Ammonium Laureth Sulfate.
---
MEA / TEA / DEA  
Substances that can penetrate the skin and form nitrosamines (carcinogenic).  
On labels, they appear as: Cocamide DEA, Oleamide DEA, Lauramide DEA, Cocamide TEA, Oleamide TEA, Lauramide TEA, Cocamide MEA, Oleamide MEA, Lauramide MEA, Linoleamide DEA, Myristamide DEA, Stearamide DEA, DEA-Cethyl Phosphate, DEA-Oleth-3 Phosphate, TEA-Lauryl Sulfate, Thiethanoamine.
---
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT  
Many cosmetic substances are not biodegradable or degrade very slowly, remaining in the environment for a long time and altering ecosystems.  
Examples: Zeolite, EDTA, Hydroxyethylcellulose, 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol (Bronopol), Triclosan.
---
ARTIFICIAL COLORANTS  
Synthetic colorants are indicated with the acronym CI (Colour Index) followed by a five-digit code (e.g., CI 42090). They are usually located toward the end of the ingredient list.

Final Rule of Thumb  
If, when reading the label, you see ingredients ending with:  
- **-one / -xane / -thicone** (silicones)  
- **-fate** or containing “eth” (sulfates)  
- **paraben** / **-ycol** or acronyms in capital letters (PEG, PPG, DEA, MEA, MIPA, EDTA)  

→ you can safely consider this product **unnatural and to be avoided**!
