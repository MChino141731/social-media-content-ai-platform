Cosmetics with Green INCI: Ingredients to Look for in Natural Skincare Products
The best cosmetic products with a good INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients) contain plant-derived ingredients, vegetable oils and butters, and are free from harsh synthetic substances. Among the ingredients to look for, here are some examples:
Nourishing vegetable oils
- Coconut oil (moisturizing function)
- Jojoba oil (balancing effect, similar to skin's natural sebum)
- Sweet Almond oil (soothing and elasticizing properties)
Emollient vegetable butters
- Shea Butter (nourishing and regenerating action)
- Cocoa Butter (protects and moisturizes)
Botanical extracts and natural actives
- Aloe Vera (soothing and hydrating ingredient)
- Chamomile and Calendula (calming and anti-inflammatory effects)
Antioxidants and vitamins
